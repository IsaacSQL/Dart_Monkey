Dart Monkey 2024
This is a project related to ongioing financial data analysis and data scraping I am ecperimenting with.
The initial project is very simple to usem but has limited options for data scraping and can be a little cluttered in its output.
When run, the project will pull KPIs from the stocks on the Russel 1,000 Index. These will be output into seperate JSON files named {Ticker}.json.

I have heard that data from yahoo finance is not the most reliable or up to date, so use any data for educational purposes only.
